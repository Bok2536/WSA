To install WSA run the "Run.bat" file.

If you getting error "Couldn't Start" virtualization is disabled,
check the "Virtual Machine Platform" in "Turn Windows features on or off" and restart the PC.
Then, run the CMD as administrator and type this command "bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto" and restart the PC again.

You fixed this error.

Enjoy!
